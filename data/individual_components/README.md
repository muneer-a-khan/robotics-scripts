# Individual Component Images

## Instructions for Taking Photos:

1. **Lighting**: Use bright, even lighting. Avoid harsh shadows.
2. **Background**: Use a plain white or light-colored background.
3. **Angle**: Take photos from multiple angles:
   - Top-down view (main)
   - 30-degree angle
   - Side view
4. **Distance**: Fill 60-80% of the frame with the component.
5. **Focus**: Ensure the component is in sharp focus.
6. **Quantity**: Take 5-10 images per component for best results.

## Directory Structure:
Each component should have its own folder with multiple images:
- battery_holder/: 5-10 images of battery holders
- led/: 5-10 images of LEDs (different colors)
- switch/: 5-10 images of switches
- etc.

## File Naming:
Use descriptive names like:
- battery_holder_01.jpg
- battery_holder_02.jpg
- led_red_01.jpg
- led_blue_01.jpg

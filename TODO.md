## TO DO - Image Segmentation

- Make the JSON output into some sort of graph format that has connected nodes and each connection maybe is the wires or something
- node property should be name of component and the value should be the state (on or off) 
- make more circuit combinations and train and make dataset
- 1-2 fps is fine
